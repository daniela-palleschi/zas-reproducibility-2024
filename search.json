If you are currently in the middle of analysing some data, you may not want to update R right now. In this case, just make note of which version you’re currently running (e.g., by running R.version in the Console)\n\n\n\nInstall or update RStudio\n\nI am currently using RStudio version 2023.12.1+402, as I encountered issues when updating to 2024.04.2+764 in April when it was released. As a rule of thumb, I update R and/or RStudio a few months after their initial release, and when I know I have time to fix any bugs that might pop up (i.e., I don’t have a looming deadline)",

The result of this “crisis” is a move towards Open Science Practices, which emphasise transparency along all stages of research (conception, planning, data collection, data cleaning, data analysis, reporting).\nThe issue became more widespread with the publication of Ioannidis (2005), entitled Most published research findigns are false. This paper defined bias in terms of design, analysis, and presentation factors with a focus on issues with p-values and statistical power. Since then there have been many replication attempts of influential (and lesser influential) papers. Strikingly, Open Science Collaboration (2015) reports 100 psychological studies run by 270 collaborators. They reported significant effects in only 36% of replications, with 47% of originally reported effects falling within 95% CIs of the replication effect. In essence: fewer significant findings and smaller effect sizes were found in replication studies compared to the original 100 studies Figure 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Source: Open Science Collaboration (2015) (all rights reserved)"
