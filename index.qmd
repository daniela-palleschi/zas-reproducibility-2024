This website contains slides for a two-part workshop given given by Daniela Palleschi at the [Leibniz-Zentrum Allgemeinesprachwissenschaft (ZAS)](https://ssol.ff.cuni.cz/) Berlin. The tools discussed are specific to the R enviornment, but the concepts are universal and programming language agnostic. The materials are re-structured from various other renditions of the workshop, all of which were based on a semester-length course on the same topic given at the Humboldt-UniversitÃ¤t zu Berlin in the summer semester 2024. The materials for the semester-length course are more exhaustive, and can be viewed [here](https://daniela-palleschi.github.io/r4repro_SoSe2024/).

## Schedule

@tbl-sched shows the tentative plan for the workshop and may be adjusted based on the needs of the participants.

## How to navigate this website

Each topic is listed in the sidebar in chronological order. Three output formats are available, all with the same content:

1. HTML page (landing page)
2. PDF of content (sub-optimally formatted)
3. Slides in RevealJS format

The contents were formatted for the slide output. Tables and figures may be too large/small in HTML and PDF format (especially the latter). Each page of the website presents the HTML format. The other 2 formats can be viewed by clicking on their symbol under 'Other Formats' (right sidebar).

# Preparation

It is assumed you have at least some basic familiarity with R and R Studio. Please at the very least make sure you have the required software before Day 1.

## Software: R and RStudio

Please make sure you have recent versions of R and RStudio installed prior to the workshop. Below you will find information on how to check which version of R and RStudio you currently have, and how to install or update them as needed.

### Check software versions

#### R

To check which version of R you currently have, run the command `R.version$version.string` in the Console (to print just the version name and release date), or `R.version$nickname` (to print the nickname).

```{r filename="In the Console: print R version and release date"}
R.version$version.string
```

```{r filename="In the Console: print R version nickname"}
R.version$nickname
```

#### R

To check which version of RStudio you currently have, run the command `R.version$version.string` in the Console (to print just the version name and release date), or `R.version$nickname` (to print the nickname). Be sure to include these only in the Console, as Rmarkdown/Quarto scripts will not be able to run these commands.

```{r filename="In the Console: print RStudio version number"}
#| eval: false
RStudio.Version()$version
```

```{r filename="In the Console: print RStudio version nickname"}
#| eval: false
RStudio.Version()$release_name
```

Alternatively, you can go to `Help > About RStudio` in RStudio. You should see a pop-up like @fig-RStudio.

```{r}
#| label: fig-RStudio
#| fig-cap: "Help > About RStudio"
#| out-width: 60%
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("media", "about_RStudio.png"))
```

### Intall/update software

1. [Install or update R](https://www.r-project.org/) 
    + N.B., I am currently using version 4.4.1 (Race for Your Life, 2024-06-14)
    + having an R version from 2022.07 or later should suffice
    
::: {.callout-warning}
### Disclaimer: Updating R

Beware that updating R can interfere with on-going R projects you are currently working on, most notably because you will need to re-install packages (and thus you may be installing more recent package versions which may break existing code). If you are currently in the middle of analysing some data, you may not want to update R right now. In this case, just make note of which version you're currently running (e.g., by running `R.version` in the Console)
:::

2. [Install or update RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
    + I am currently using RStudio version 2023.12.1+402, as I encountered issues when updating to 2024.04.2+764 in April when it was released. As a rule of thumb, I update R and/or RStudio a few months after their initial release, and when I know I have time to fix any bugs that might pop up (i.e., I don't have a looming deadline)

# Suggested readings (before, during, or after the workshop)

There is currently a wealth of literature on the topic of reproducibility, both in terms of meta-science reviews of rates of reproducibility and in terms of best-practice advice. Some reading I would suggest for a soft introduction into the latter would be:

- @nagler_coding_1995
- @bowers_how_2016
- @wilson_good_2017
- @seibold_6_nodate

For a book-length treatment of R-specific reproducible workflows:

- @rodrigues_building_nodate

And for an overview of R-specific data analysis suggestions, I recommend the following on-line resources:

- @bryan_what_nodate
- @bryan_chapter_nodate

For more general discussions on Open Science Practices:

- @kathawalla_easing_2021
- @cruwell_seven_2019
